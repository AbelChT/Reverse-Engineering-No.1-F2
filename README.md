# Reverse Engineering No.1 F2
In this project, reverse engineering is carried out on the Smartwatch No.1 F2 of the Dtone brand.
As a result of this reverse engineering, the communication protocol used between the original application and the smartwatch firmware have been documented (can be found in the folder [protocol_documentation](:/protocol_documentation)), a python framework that allows interaction with the Smartwatch was created(can be found in the folder [python_framework](./python_framework)) and an Android application that replaces the original application was created(can be found in the folder [android_application](:/android_application)).

A more exhaustive description of the project can be found in the associated article (can be found in the file [article.pdf](./article.pdf)).

Also, a short introduction to the reverse engineering process is provided (can be found in the file [reverse_ingeenering_process.md](./reverse_ingeenering_process.md)).
